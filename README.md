Words + Date + Day pebble watch face

This project is a fork of Dhertz's words-date-pebble-watchface.  It is based on a slightly dated version of Dhertz's source
code.  This is a mix of the simplicity and text (with "oh") watchfaces with the day of the week for the pebble smart watch.
This watchface could be very easily created with a simple change in Dhertz's num2words.h file by changing his DAY
definition from 0 to 1 and adding a comma after the "%a' in his DATE_FORMAT definition.  The reason I decided to create
this fork was for the experience of using GitHub (first time), for successfully compiling a Pebble watchface using the
SDK (also a first), and because the font used for all of the text watchfaces that I have seen that do this, is either too
small for me to read quickly/easily, or it does not include the day of the week (which is important to me).
